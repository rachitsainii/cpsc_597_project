# Tumor Hunter : A Machine-Learning system designed to detect the presence of different types of Brain Tumors in MRI Images.

## Developers : Rachit Saini, Xuan Bui

## Description: Tumor Hunter is a web-based application developed to detect the presence of brain tumors in MRI images and classify them into different tumor types. Leveraging machine learning techniques, particularly Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and transfer learning with EfficientNetB0, Tumor Hunter offers a non-invasive and efficient solution for brain tumor diagnosis.
